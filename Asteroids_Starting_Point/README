Last update as of: 12/9 - Andy
A lot of updates as you can see in the commits. Just know that I commented out the press 1 to skip levels button on the original game.

Things added/changed:
What I did all day today was just going through the game and fixing everything that I could and get it working as close as possible to 
the original game.
