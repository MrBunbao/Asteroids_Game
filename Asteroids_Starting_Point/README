for extra credit we added some in-game power-ups including one that go as follows:

index 0 power-up allows for rapid fire for 4 seconds.
index 1 power-up grants an extra life.
index 2 maximizes the score multiplier for 4 seconds.
index 3 allows a hot shot when the player presses "1"(hard to describe but pretty cool make sure to shoot one).
index 4 allows invincibility for 4 seconds.

change the parameter in the constructor of Power up in EnhancedController/actionPerformed after "this" keyword from RANDOM.nextInt(5) to the
desired power-up and the power-up you want will appear as a little 15X15 box after a few seconds on level 1 of enhanced mode.
run the ship over it and you'll see what power up you got(and how long you have left before it stops working if applicable)in the bottom right corner.
in the bottom left corner you'll see the multiplier which is based on how quickly you've been destroying enemies.
